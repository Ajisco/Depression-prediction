## 📍 Problem Statement
The occurence of depression has become very rampant in recent times.<br>
Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest which can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.<br>
It varies in severity from mild to severe and they present with some different symptoms.<br>
What makes it more dangerous is that one might not be aware if affected by the symptoms.<br><br><br>


## 📍 Objective 
This projects centers on building a predictive machine learning app to predict whether or not a person is depressed and to tell how depressed the person is.<br>
The app should also tell the reason for the prediction and how to work on getting better.
<br><br><br>

## 📍 Data
The dataset was in a tabular (CSV) format and was gotten from a research studies, which was subsequently cleaned and wrangled in preparation for machine learning.<br><br><br>


## 📍 Skills and Technologies

* Programming (Python, JavaScript)
* Data wrangling (Pandas, Numpy)
* Data Analysis and Visualization. (Numpy, Stat, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* Machine/ Deep learning (Tensorflow, Scikit Learn, XGBoost)
* Backend (Flask)
* Frontend (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
* Cloud deployment (Render, Heroku)

## 📍 Notebook
#### This Jupyter notebook containing some exploratory analysis, model training and evaluation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Ajisco/Depression-prediction/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb) <br><br><br>

## 📍 App Features
1. Has a section to fill form to collect data.
2. Machine learning predicts whether or not a person is depressed and tells how depressed the person is.
3. The app also tells the reason for the prediction and how to work on getting better.
4. Web app compatible by every device. <br><br><br>




## 📍 DEPLOYMENT 🚀

#### This app is deployed at [Render](https://render.com)
	
#### You can access it [Here](https://depressfbi.onrender.com) <br><br><br>


## 📍 Limitations
1. The dataset used was not large enough, could be outdated and can't be said to have generalized well despite the high metric values.
2. The app's interface could be better.
3. The app loads slowly.<br><br><br>

## 📍 To improve
1. I would love to improve the dataset in size and quality.
2. I would love to add an NLP virtual assistant system in form of a medical chatbot to attend to users before seeing a specialist.
<br><br><br>
